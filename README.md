# Corne Layout - Snazzy

Notes for getting QMK to build custom corne layout, this in no way is totally
comprehensive or to say I am anything close to an expert. Just a easy
way for me to log my build and compilation struggles and successes that
hopefully will help others on the way!

## Overview

Building your custom hex files can be a pain so using github actions and
CI should make the process easier.

## Building

Building the keyboard was fairly simple. I went through [boardsource](https://boardsource.xyz) to purchase the components 
and it all arrived quickly. Following the instructions on [foostans
project](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and they are extremely well
put together and easy to follow (if you read unlike what I did).

### 1. LEDs

## Compiling

This project uses GitHub actions to build out the .hex file for flashing
the keyboard..

## Flashing

You will have to use the [QMK ToolBox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) tool to flash the keyboard or use
the [QMK CLI](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/cli/cli)

## Extras

- [Image2Cpp](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/)
- [QMK Logo Editor](https://joric.github.io/qle/)
